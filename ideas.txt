*Ideas

bigger ideas
- book stats: all time and by year
- should I be using classes?
- reviews
- should it save to the same directory? maybe one software like version and one for the web?

flexibility
- drag and drop to rearrange the categories
- delete books

data validation
- what if title has a comma?
- what if there are repeats?
- what if list in different order
- throw errors if things are wrong

small things to add
- buttons next to labels for sorting

problems
- today not working again
- sort by date doesn't work on second spreadsheet addition until sort by alphabetical


other
- need to protect things that are being entered?



dealt with: 
- download csv file has 0,1,2 on first line
- input csv unconnected
- sort broken and why does it seem to be running when I don't press it? (solution: function needed return)
