bigger ideas
- book stats by genre, pages, most read author etc.

- multiple script files

flexibility
- drag and drop to rearrange the categories
- delete books
- change entries
- accept Excel files

data validation
- what if title has a comma?
- what if there are repeats?
- what if list in different order
- throw errors if things are wrong
- protect against hackers

small things to add
- buttons next to labels for sorting
- better spacing on the table

problems
- today not working again
- multi paragraph reviews

dealt with: 
- download csv file has 0,1,2 on first line
- input csv unconnected
- sort broken and why does it seem to be running when I don't press it? (solution: function needed return)
- can't copy to array onload
- in browser storage
- spacing in table
